# 42HN_Piscine_C#-August 2025

This repository contains my solutions to most of the C exercises from the 42 Piscine (C00–C08) at 42 Heilbronn, done between July and August 2025 on a Linux system using the terminal and `gcc`.

> Note: A few exercises are missing (for example, the 10 queens backtracking exercise in C08 is not implemented).

## What’s inside

The projects cover the basic foundations of C programming:

- C00–C02: basic syntax, functions, simple I/O, and nested loops (two and three levels)
- C03–C05: string manipulation, custom standard-library-like functions, basic maths and recursion
- C06–C07: command-line arguments, pointers, arrays, and string/array manipulation
- C08: `struct`, header files, and organizing code across multiple files

Throughout these exercises I practiced:

- Working with pointers and arrays  
- Writing and using my own header files  
- Implementing basic recursive functions (factorial, Fibonacci, etc.)  
- Using dynamic memory allocation with `malloc` and `free`  
- Thinking about algorithms and problem decomposition on small C exercises  

Feel free to use this repository as a reference or inspiration while learning C.
