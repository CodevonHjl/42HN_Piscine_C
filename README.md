This repository contains my solutions to **most** of the C exercises from the 42 Piscine (C00–C08) at 42 Heilbronn, done between **July and August 2025** on a Linux system using the terminal and `gcc`.

> 💡 Note: A few exercises are missing (for example, the 10 queens backtracking exercise in C08 is not implemented).

## 📂 What’s inside

The projects cover the basic foundations of C programming:

- 🧱 **C00–C02**: basic syntax, functions, simple I/O, and nested loops (two and three levels)  
- 🔤 **C03–C05**: string manipulation, custom standard-library-like functions, basic math and recursion  
- 🧵 **C06–C07**: command-line arguments, pointers, arrays, and string/array manipulation  
- 🧩 **C08**: `struct`, header files, and organizing code across multiple files  

---

## 🧠 What I practiced

Throughout these exercises I practiced:

- 📌 Working with **pointers** and arrays  
- 📁 Writing and using my own **header files**  
- 🔁 Implementing basic **recursive functions** (factorial, Fibonacci, etc.)  
- 📦 Using **dynamic memory allocation** with `malloc` and `free`  
- 🧮 Thinking about **algorithms** and problem decomposition on small C exercises  

Feel free to use this repository as a reference or inspiration while learning C.
